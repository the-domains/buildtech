            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why BIM Education Needs Another Look > ENGINEERING.com</h1><p>Building information modeling (BIM) is quickly becoming a universal tool. It's used by architects, engineers and facility managers across the globe and is mandated in countries such as Australia, Brazil, China, Germany and the UK. However, there's one universal issue when it comes to BIM: a lack of consistency in education.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/05888d1be1260e98cddefa66fa37f06aa287677c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Architecture Firm to Bring Virtual Reality to BIM > ENGINEERING.com</h1><p>Virtual Reality (VR) has all kinds of applications-and although it's currently most popular as a gaming tool, it could be quite useful for architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) as well. Practical use of VR in AEC is currently the subject of extensive research, but it could become much more accessible following a recent partnership between architecture firm NBBJ and VR developer Visual Vocal.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6601ee5d5dc4d823267353db4a17080acf2e7798.jpg"></article>]]></description>
