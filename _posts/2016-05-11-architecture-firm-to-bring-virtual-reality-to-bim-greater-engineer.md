description: "Virtual Reality (VR) has all kinds of applications-and although it's currently most popular as a gaming tool, it could be quite useful for architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) as well. Practical use of VR in AEC is currently the subject of extensive research, but it could become much more accessible following a recent partnership between architecture firm NBBJ and VR developer Visual Vocal."
